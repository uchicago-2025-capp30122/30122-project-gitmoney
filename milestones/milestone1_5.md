# To-Do
311 - Riley <br>
Alderman - Libby & Getnet <br>
Alex -- attempts subproject 1 <br>

# The Vision
## Everything Going to Plan
We'd be able to match every MenuMoney project with a contract and neighboring 311 calls
Team's GIS expert Alex is optimistic about our ability to clean up cross streets

### The Realistic Dataset
**311 (API)**
- taking the lat/longs from there
- Bare Minimum: placing the calls in the wards

**Menu Money**
- putting these in wards

**Aldermen**
- Grabbing the list of Aldermen from wikipedia 

### Dream Dataset
Stuff we would do if we had all the time in the world
**EXTRA Task 1** isolate the geo from menu money to be able to map
- menu money project
- 311 calls
  
**EXTRA Task 2**: City of Chicago Contracts (Bulk Data)

## The Viz
A map! <br>
- filter based on
  -  project category
  -  date/year
  -  alderman
  -  311 call type
- map shows
  - money spent on [top 5 311 calls]

# Questions for James
- Can our command line interface just produce a GUI? Or are you asking us to produce a map into the command line? (Please say GUI)
