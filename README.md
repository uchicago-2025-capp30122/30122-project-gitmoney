# Project Repository Template

This template is intentionally mostly empty, to give you experience starting a project from scratch.

A good first command would be to run `uv init` and add some libraries and tools that you are using.

Before the final milestone submission, you will need to replace this file with a README as described here: https://capp30122.netlify.app/coursework/project/#readmemd

# Rules for Github Management/Project Management
We are baby Github users and terrified of branches and merging and rebasing, so we are creating rules for ourselves. 

1) Text the group to let them know what file you're working on.
2) Put real comments in the Git commits —- have clear messages so we understand what we do
3) Comment your code! Add docstrings!
4) Keep everyone updated on what you did via Slack
