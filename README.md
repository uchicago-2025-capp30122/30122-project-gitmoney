# Project Repository Template

This template is intentionally mostly empty, to give you experience starting a project from scratch.

A good first command would be to run `uv init` and add some libraries and tools that you are using.

Before the final milestone submission, you will need to replace this file with a README as described here: https://capp30122.netlify.app/coursework/project/#readmemd

# Rules for Github Management/Project Management
We are baby Github users and terrified of branches and merging and rebasing, so we are creating rules for ourselves. 

1) Text the group to let them know what file you're working on.
2) Put real comments in the Git commits —- have clear messages so we understand what we do
3) Comment your code! Add docstrings!
4) Keep everyone updated on what you did via Slack

# To-Do
311 - Riley <br>
Alderman - Libby & Getnet <br>
Alex -- attempts subproject 1 <br>

# The Vision
## Everything Going to Plan
We'd be able to match every MenuMoney project with a contract and neighboring 311 calls
Team's GIS expert Alex is optimistic about our ability to clean up cross streets

### The Realistic Dataset
**311 (API)**
- taking the lat/longs from there
- Bare Minimum: placing the calls in the wards

**Menu Money**
- putting these in wards

**Aldermen**
- Grabbing the list of Aldermen from wikipedia 

### Dream Dataset
Stuff we would do if we had all the time in the world
**EXTRA Task 1** isolate the geo from menu money to be able to map
- menu money project
- 311 calls
  
**EXTRA Task 2**: City of Chicago Contracts (Bulk Data)

## The Viz
A map! <br>
- filter based on
  -  project category
  -  date/year
  -  alderman
  -  311 call type
- map shows
  - money spent on [top 5 311 calls]

# Questions for James
- Can our command line interface just produce a GUI? Or are you asking us to produce a map into the command line? (Please say GUI)
