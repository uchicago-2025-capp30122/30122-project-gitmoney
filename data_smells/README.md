We could either
a) eliminate them
b) check with Jake to be like -- you by chance know what's up with that? - or perhaps email a local journalist who may be like "oh yeah, that's a thing"

We should probably email them ...

## Description

- Alex is hoping to grab the addresses from this, but we shall see.

To-Do

- Email Jake and/or local journalist to understand why two numbers are negative -- especially because one is < $10k
